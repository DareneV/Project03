		<h3>Publicity for LOGOS</h3> <figure><img src="images/marketing.png" alt="Advertise!"></figure>

			<p>As Publicity Manager for LOGOS one of the ways I promote  the club and events we hold is through ad screensavers throughout campus. There are also flyers of course, but those aren't as visually entertaining. Other forms of advertising will not be featured as the screensaver ads are my favorite at the moment and shall be highlighted accordingly.</p>
