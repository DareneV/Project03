	<h2>Accomplishments</h2>

		<h3>Publicity for LOGOS</h3>

			<p>As Publicity Manager for LOGOS one of the ways I promote the club and events we hold is through ad screensavers throughout campus. There's also flyers of course, but those aren't as visually entertaining.</p>

		<h3>Website Development</h3>

			<p>Although not professional work I have produced websites for my advanced front-end development course. In these other websites various skills have been implemented as they've been learned throughout the course.</p>
